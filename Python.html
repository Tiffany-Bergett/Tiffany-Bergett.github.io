                                    <h3>From Catch-22 to a Master in Tech </h3>
                                    <p>The Catch-22 of the job market is all too familiar: you need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience. After a challenging search for an entry-level role, I found my way to <a href="https://www.extern.com" target="_blank"><strong>Extern.com</strong></a>, a platform that promised to solve this very problem. What followed was a project that not only gave me a portfolio piece but also changed my career trajectory and cemented my love for tech.</p>
                                    <p>This is the story of my Externship with a major tech company, working on a project with a strong focus on Market & Competitor Analysis for Beats by Dre.</p>

                                    <h3>Decoding the Wireless Speaker Market</h3>
                                    <p>My project began with a core business challenge: "What are the key factors driving consumer interest in high-fidelity wireless speakers, and how do evolving preferences influence this market?"</p>
                                    <p>This wasn't just a theoretical exercise. It was a real-world problem for a global brand, and it was my job to find the answers. To tackle this, I needed to go beyond what I learned in my boot camp and dive into new skills and tools.</p>

                                    <h3>My Methodical Approach</h3>
                                    <p>This project was a true test of my skills, taking me from the foundational stages to a final, strategic deliverable.</p>
                                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
                                        <li>Foundational Research & Planning</li>
                                            <p>I started by getting into the mind of the customer. I used frameworks like <strong>AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)</strong> to create a customer journey map and an ideal consumer profile. This step was crucial for ensuring that my analysis would be human-centric and focused on a real business problem.</p>

                                    <img src="images/Blog/BBDBlog1.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

                                        <li>Data Acquisition & Analysis</h4>
                                            <p>With the groundwork laid, I dived into the data. I used <strong>Python</strong> to scrape and clean a massive dataset of nearly 5,000 Survey responses and Amazon reviews for key Beats by Dre competitors like JBL, Bose, Sony, and Marshall. This was my first time working with messy, real-world data, and I leveraged libraries like <strong>Pandas & Numpy</strong> to prepare it for analysis.</p>
                                            <p>I then moved on to <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>, using <strong>Matplotlib</strong> and <strong>Seaborn</strong> to visualize trends. I analyzed review lengths, ratings, and common keywords to find initial patterns.</p>
                                <div class="image fit">
                                    <img src="images/Blog/BBDBlog2.PNG" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

                                        <li>Advanced Insights with AI</h4>
                                            <p>The most exciting part of this project was applying advanced techniques and modern tools to gain a deeper understanding of the data. To get started, I imported a full suite of Python libraries for my analysis, including:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): </strong>A powerful platform for working with human language data, which was essential for preparing the text for analysis.</li>
                                                <li><strong>textblob: </strong>A library for performing sentiment analysis and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</li>
                                                <li><strong>wordcloud: </strong>To visually represent the most common words in customer reviews.</li>
                                                <li><strong>google.generativeai (Gemini API): </strong>An advanced AI tool used to perform qualitative analysis and summarize key takeaways from the sentiment analysis.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>I also leveraged AI tools like <strong>Gamma & Claude</strong> for a presentation slide-deck and dashboard creation. This felt like the "next tier" of learning, as I explored advanced prompting techniques to find hidden insights in open-ended survey responses and build a dynamic dashboard.</p>
                                    </ol>
                                <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto;">

                                    <h3>Actionable Insights for a Global Brand</h3>
                                    <p>The result of my work was a comprehensive analysis that led to clear, actionable recommendations. I delivered a presentation and an AI-driven dashboard that provided a data-backed roadmap for the company's product strategy.</p>
                                    <p>Here are a few key findings from the analysis:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Premium is Profitable:</strong> My analysis found that <u>20% of users</u> were willing to pay over <code>$200</code> for superior audio quality.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Targeted Demographics:</strong> I identified that <u>Gen Z</u> prioritizes <code>clarity, powerful bass, and loudness</code>, while <u>Millennials</u> value <code>balanced sound and brand reputation</code>.</li>
                                        <li><strong>The Path Forward:</strong> My recommendations included focusing product development on <i>superior sound and design, a digital-first marketing strategy, and competitive pricing</i> to secure market leadership.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>This project was a powerful reminder that data analysis is not just about numbers, but about telling a compelling story that solves a business problem.</p>

                                    <h3>The Career Pivot to a Tech Passion</h3>
                                    <p>This externship was a pivotal moment in my career pivot. It transformed my love for data into a love for tech, demonstrating how the right tools and a structured approach can bridge the gap between education and real-world application. The skills I gained are invaluable.</p>
                                    <p>My success in this project was the final confirmation I needed to take the next step: enrolling in a Master of Science in Information Technology program. I am excited to continue building on this foundation and applying my unique blend of business acumen and technical skills to new challenges.</p>
