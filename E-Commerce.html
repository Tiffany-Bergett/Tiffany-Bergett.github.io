										<h3>Cracking the E-Commerce Code: My Adventure in Data Decoding</h3>
										<p>Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes of your favorite online stores? How do they know what you like, what you might buy next, and why you sometimes abandon your shopping cart at the last minute (we've all been there!)? Well, in my latest project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, I got to play detective and uncover these secrets using the power of data analysis!</p>
                                        <p>This wasn't just any project—it was a deep dive into the world of e-commerce, where I transformed raw website activity logs into juicy business insights. Think of it as turning a jumbled mess of puzzle pieces into a clear picture of customer behavior.</p>
										
                                        <h3>From Data Jungle to Data Playground</h3>
										<p>Imagine a massive spreadsheet filled with every click, every view, every purchase on an e-commerce website. That was my starting point—a data jungle! My first task was to tame this wilderness, filtering, cleaning, and organizing the data into something usable. It was like going on a data safari, clearing paths and labeling everything along the way.</p>

                                        <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2e58fde1699848d2b12a2e3284e7867e?sid=0999d9f0-df9f-4a30-9665-ffb61487a7da" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog/E-Commerce Jungle.png" alt="" style="width: 75%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/></a>


										<h3>Building the Customer Journey: Funnels and Repeat Customers</h3>
										<p>With the data tamed, I built two key tools to understand the customer journey:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>The Conversion Funnel - The Buyer's Adventure:</u> This funnel tracks the steps a customer takes from discovering a product to actually buying it. It's like following a breadcrumb trail! My analysis revealed a bit of a bottleneck: while many people added items to their carts (a respectable 29% conversion rate), only 10% actually completed the purchase. This was a big "aha!" moment, suggesting there might be issues with the checkout process or product pages that need fixing. Maybe the shipping costs were a surprise, or the checkout process was too complicated. Time to investigate!</li>
											<li><u>Retention Rates - Will They Be Back?:</u> This metric tells you how many customers become repeat buyers. I focused on a "cohort" of customers who made their first purchase in September 2020. The results? Not so great. After just one month, only 13% were still buying, and by month four, it was down to a measly 3%. Ouch! This clearly showed a need for strategies to keep customers coming back for more.</li>
										</ul>

                                        <h3>My Data-Driven Detective Work: Recommendations for Success</h3>
										<p>Based on my data sleuthing, I presented the e-commerce company with some key recommendations:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Conquer Cart Abandonment:</u>  Those abandoned carts are like lost treasure! By figuring out why people are leaving without buying, the company can make changes to the checkout process and win back those potential sales.</li>
											<li><u>Woo Repeat Customers:</u> Happy customers come back for more! Strategies like personalized emails, loyalty programs, and top-notch customer support can turn one-time buyers into loyal fans.</li>
                                            <li><u>Ask the Customers!:</u> Sometimes, the best way to find out what's wrong is to just ask! Gathering customer feedback through surveys or reviews can provide invaluable insights.</li>
                                            <li><u>Keep Analyzing!:</u> Data analysis is an ongoing adventure. Regularly checking the data keeps the company on track and helps them spot new opportunities and challenges.</li>
										</ul>

                                        <p>This project was a blast! I got to use my business intelligence skills to turn raw data into a compelling story and provide real, actionable advice for a business. It's like being a data superhero, using numbers to save the day!</p>
