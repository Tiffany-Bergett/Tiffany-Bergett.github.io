										<h3>Hey everyone!</h3>
										<p>So, It's been one year since I wrapped up a super interesting project analyzing Zomato's customer base, and I wanted to share how I dove into the data and what I found. If you don't know, Zomato is like the go-to app in India for anyone who loves food.</p>
                                        <p>As a budding BI Analyst, this project was a fantastic opportunity to flex my analytical muscles and uncover some tasty insights. This was the first project that I had complete control over from planning to presentation. My mission was to figure out who Zomato's customers are, how we can group them, and what makes them order all that delicious food.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/Tiffany-Bergett/BI_Analytic_Projects/tree/main/Zomato" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog/Zomato 1.webp" alt="" style="width: 75%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/></a>
										
										<h3>Data Dive - Not as Scary as it Sounds!</h3>
										<p>First things first, I had to get my hands dirty with the data. Luckily, the files weren’t huge, so I could use good ol’ spreadsheets to clean things up. Think of it as prepping your ingredients before cooking – essential, but not the main course.</p>
                                        <p>Then came the fun part: segmentation analysis. This is where we start grouping customers based on what they do and who they are. It's like sorting people into Hogwarts Houses to understand them better.</p>

										<h3>What I Found (The Fun Part)</h3>
										<p>Here's a little sneak peek into what I discovered:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Zomato's crowd is on the younger side, mostly around 23 years old, and a lot of them are single guys.</li>
											<a href="https://github.com/Tiffany-Bergett/BI_Analytic_Projects/tree/main/Zomato" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog/Zomato 2.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/></a>
											<li>There's a good mix of genders, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.</li>
											<a href="https://github.com/Tiffany-Bergett/BI_Analytic_Projects/tree/main/Zomato" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog/Zomato 3.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/></a>
											<li>Most customers have small family sizes (2-3), are educated, but here’s a twist – a lot of them are unemployed.</li>
											<li>Those who are employed tend to be earning less.</li>
											<a href="https://github.com/Tiffany-Bergett/BI_Analytic_Projects/tree/main/Zomato" class="image fit"><img src="images/Blog/Zomato 4.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/></a>
										</ul>
										<p>To visualize this, I created a dashboard with some cool charts and graphs. Because who doesn't love a good visual?</p>

										<h3>RFM Analysis - Or, How to Keep Customers Coming Back for More</h3>
										<p>I also used something called RFM analysis. It might sound technical, but it's actually pretty straightforward. It's all about:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Recency:</u>  How recently someone placed an order.</li>
											<li><u>Frequency:</u> How often they order.</li>
											<li><u>Monetary:</u>  How much they spend.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>By looking at these factors, we can segment customers even further and figure out the best ways to keep them engaged. It's like a restaurant knowing its regulars and what they love!</p>

										<h3>So What? (Why This Matters)</h3>
										<p>All this data is super useful for Zomato because it helps them:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Target their marketing:</u>  Instead of blasting everyone with the same ads, they can tailor their messages to different groups.</li>
											<li><u>Boost sales:</u> By understanding customer behavior, they can offer the right promotions to the right people.</li>
											<li><u>Keep customers happy:</u>  This is the ultimate goal! By providing personalized experiences, Zomato can turn one-time buyers into loyal fans.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Why This Matters to You (Potential Employer or Future Coworker)</h3>
										<p>This project shows I can:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Take raw data and turn it into something meaningful:</u>  I'm not just about numbers; I'm about insights.</li>
											<li><u>Communicate complex stuff in a way that anyone can understand:</u> No jargon, just clear and concise info.</li>
											<li><u>Provide actionable recommendations:</u>  I don't just identify problems; I offer solutions.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I'm excited to keep growing as a BI Analyst and tackle even more interesting challenges. As someone who tutors BI Analyst skills at TripleTen, I am continuously honing these skills. If you're looking for someone who's passionate about data and eager to learn, let's chat!</p>

                                        <p>I hope this gives you a fun and insightful peek into my data adventure! </p>
