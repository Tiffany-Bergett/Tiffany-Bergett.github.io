										<h3>Superstore's Return Problem</h3>
										<p>In my previous project, I acted as a data consultant for Superstore, analyzing their overall sales and profitability. One major issue I uncovered was an alarmingly high rate of product returns. So, I decided to take a closer look, focusing specifically on returns and using Tableau to tell a compelling data story for Superstore's CEO. This was my fifth project in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, and it was all about honing my skills in creating impactful dashboards and presentations.</p>

										<h3>From Data to Narrative - The Power of Storytelling</h3>
										<p>This time, my goal wasn't just to present numbers; it was to craft a narrative that would resonate with the CEO and drive action. I wanted to answer the crucial questions: Why are customers returning so many products, and what can Superstore do about it?</p>
                                        <p>I started with the same dataset as before—a spreadsheet containing detailed information on orders and returns. After joining the relevant data, I dove into the analysis, using Tableau to visualize the data from different angles.</p>
										
										<h3>Uncovering the Return Culprits</h3>
										<p>Through my visualizations, several key factors contributing to the high return rates emerged:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Problem Customers:</u> I discovered several customers with exceptionally high return rates, some even returning 100% of their purchases. This suggested potential issues with customer expectations, product suitability, or even potential fraud.</li>
											<li><u>Problem Products:</u> Similarly, certain products were returned at an unusually high rate, indicating potential problems with product quality, descriptions, or sizing information.</li>
											<li><u>Location, Location, Location:</u> Geographic analysis revealed that certain states, particularly Utah, had significantly higher return rates than others. This hinted at possible regional differences in customer preferences, shipping issues, or other location-specific factors.</li>
											<li><u>Seasonal Spikes:</u> I also found that returns spiked in August and September, following a period of increased purchases. This suggested a connection between promotional periods or seasonal buying habits and returns.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Recommendations for a Return-Free Future (Almost!)</h3>
										<p>Based on these findings, I presented the CEO with the following recommendations, packaged in a clear and compelling Tableau story:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Targeted Employee Training:</u>  I suggested providing additional training to the technology department to better assist customers in selecting the right products. This could involve improving product knowledge, providing better online resources, or offering personalized recommendations.</li>
											<li><u>Customer Outreach:</u> For customers with 100% return rates, I recommended direct outreach to understand the reasons behind their returns. This feedback could provide valuable insights into systemic issues and inform necessary changes to the website, shipping processes, or other areas.</li>
											<li><u>Immediate Action on Problem Products:</u> As a triage measure, I recommended immediately halting sales of the products with consistently high return rates. This would stop the bleeding and allow time for a more thorough investigation.</li>
											<li><u>Proactive Product Information Improvements:</u> I suggested a focused effort to improve product information, including more detailed descriptions, accurate size guides, and encouraging customer reviews through social media collaborations. This would help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and reduce the likelihood of returns.</li>
											<li><u>Policy and Promotion Adjustments:</u> Finally, I recommended considering stricter return policies or implementing return fees for purchases made in problematic states. I also suggested adjusting promotional strategies, perhaps shifting from discounts to value-added offers like free shipping, especially during peak seasons.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h3>The Power of Data Storytelling</h3>
										<p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase not just my data analysis skills but also my ability to communicate complex information effectively through data storytelling. By creating a compelling narrative with clear visualizations, I aimed to provide Superstore's CEO with the insights needed to make informed decisions and address their return problem.</p>
