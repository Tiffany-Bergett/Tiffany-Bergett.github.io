									<h1>CrewTracker Software Project</h1>
									<p>Migration and Merged Reports</p>
								</header>
								<div class="box">
									<h3>From Legacy Reports to Interactive Dashboards</h3>
									<p>Data tells a story, but sometimes that story gets lost in translation. During my first foray into the professional world as a BI Analyst, I had the opportunity to help a company, 
										CrewTracker Software, rewrite their data narrative. They were wrestling with a common problem: an outdated reporting system that hindered their clients' ability to understand and act on 
										critical information. My team and I tackled this by migrating over 170 Crystal Reports to modern, interactive Power BI dashboards. This experience not only solidified my BI skills but also 
										highlighted the transformative power of effective data visualization.</p>
									<h3>The Crystal Reports Conundrum</h3>
									<p>CrewTracker Software provides solutions for managing field service operations. Like many established companies, they relied heavily on Crystal Reports, a legacy reporting tool. While 
										functional, Crystal Reports can be cumbersome, especially for complex data analysis and interactive exploration. Imagine trying to piece together a dynamic, 360-degree view of your business 
										from static, printed reports – that's the challenge CrewTracker's clients faced.</p>
									<p>Our mission was clear - modernize CrewTracker's reporting system by converting these static reports into dynamic, user-friendly Power BI dashboards. This would empower their clients to:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
										<li>Effortlessly explore their data.</li>
										<li>Identify trends and patterns.</li>
										<li>Make data-driven decisions with confidence.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>A Three-Pronged Approach to Transformation</h3>
									<p>To efficiently tackle this large-scale migration, we adopted a three-tiered approach:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>First Responders: Extracting the Blueprint</li>
											<ul>
												<li>5 of our 20 externs had the first task - to dissect the existing Crystal Reports and document their key elements. This step was crucial "reverse engineering," laying the 
													groundwork for accurate replication in Power BI. This involved:</li>
													<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
														<li>Connecting to the CrewTracker workstation via Remote Desktop Connection.</li>
														<li>Capturing screenshots of the report layout and field details.</li>
														<li>Exporting PDF views of the reports.</li>
														<li>Most importantly, extracting the underlying SQL queries and formula fields.</li>
													</ul>
												<li>As a First Responder, I personally cataloged 91 Crystal Reports.</li>
											</ul>
										<li>Power BI Team: Building the Interactive Future</li>
											<ul>
												<li>All 20 externs joined the Power BI team. We were responsible for the core conversion and modernization work:</li>
													<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
														<li>Translating the extracted SQL queries and formulas into Power BI.</li>
														<li>Designing interactive dashboards that went beyond the limitations of the original static reports.</li>
														<li>Creating merged reports, where appropriate, to consolidate information and provide a more holistic view.</li>
													</ul>
												<li> I successfully converted 3 Crystal Reports into a complex and interactive merged Power BI dashboard</li>
											</ul>
										<li>Peer Reviewers: Ensuring Accuracy and Quality</li>
											<ul>
												<li>To maintain quality, each Power BI report underwent rigorous peer review. This involved:</li>
													<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
														<li>Verifying the accurate replication of the original report's layout and functionality.</li>
														<li>Confirming the accuracy of the SQL queries.</li>
														<li>Ensuring that all Crystal Report formula fields were correctly translated into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns.</li>
														<li>Assessing the overall completeness and purpose of the converted report.</li>
													</ul>
												<li>I contributed to this stage by peer-reviewing 9 Power BI reports, ensuring they met the high standards of accuracy and usability.</li>
											</ul>
									</ol>
									<h3>Diving Deeper: The Call List Merge Report</h3>
									<p>One of the most challenging and rewarding tasks was creating a merged Power BI dashboard for the "Call List" reports. This involved:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
										<li>Consolidating SQL queries from three separate Crystal Reports into a single, optimized SQL Direct Query within Power BI.</li>
										<li>Designing a dashboard that accurately reflected the layout expectations of the original reports while leveraging Power BI's interactivity. This required careful consideration of how to 
											best represent the data and enable user exploration.</li>
										<li>Translating complex Crystal Report formula fields into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns. This was a critical step, as DAX provides powerful analytical capabilities but 
											requires a different syntax and approach than Crystal Reports formulas. I had to ensure that the formatting of these DAX calculations allowed for flexibility and future use.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Key Insights</h3>
									<p>This project yielded significant insights into the power of modern BI tools:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
										<li><u>Enhanced Data Accessibility:</u> Power BI dashboards provide a more intuitive and interactive way for users to explore data compared to static Crystal Reports.</li>
										<li><u>Improved Data Visualization:</u> Interactive dashboards allow for dynamic filtering, drilling down into details, and visualizing trends, leading to better understanding and faster 
											decision-making.</li>
										<li><u>Increased Efficiency:</u> By consolidating reports and automating data refreshes, Power BI can streamline reporting processes and save time.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Results: Empowering CrewTracker's Clients</h3>
									<p>By modernizing its reporting system, CrewTracker Software is now better equipped to serve its clients. The transition to Power BI enables:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
										<li><u>Deeper Data Insights:</u> Clients can now uncover hidden patterns and trends in their data, leading to more informed business strategies.</li>
										<li><u>Improved Decision-Making:</u>  Interactive dashboards provide the right information at the right time, empowering clients to make quicker and more effective decisions.</li>
										<li><u>Increased Client Satisfaction:</u> A user-friendly and insightful reporting system enhances the overall client experience.</li>
									</ul>

					<h1>Zomato Customer Analysis Segmentation</h1>
					<p>How I Used Data to Understand Zomato's Customers</p>
				</header>
				<div class="box">
					<h3>Hey everyone!</h3>
					<p>So, It's been one year since I wrapped up a super interesting project analyzing Zomato's customer
						base, and I wanted to share how I dove into the data and what I found. If you don't know, Zomato
						is like the go-to app in India for anyone who loves food.</p>
					<p>As a budding BI Analyst, this project was a fantastic opportunity to flex my analytical muscles
						and uncover some tasty insights. This was the first project that I had complete control over
						from planning to presentation. My mission was to figure out who Zomato's customers are, how we
						can group them, and what makes them order all that delicious food.</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 1.webp" alt=""
							style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
					</div>
					<h3>Data Dive - Not as Scary as it Sounds!</h3>
					<p>First things first, I had to get my hands dirty with the data. Luckily, the files weren’t huge,
						so I could use good ol’ spreadsheets to clean things up. Think of it as prepping your
						ingredients before cooking – essential, but not the main course.</p>
					<p>Then came the fun part: segmentation analysis. This is where we start grouping customers based on
						what they do and who they are. It's like sorting people into Hogwarts Houses to understand them
						better.</p>

					<h3>What I Found (The Fun Part)</h3>
					<p>Here's a little sneak peek into what I discovered:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Zomato's crowd is on the younger side, mostly around 23 years old, and a lot of them are
							single guys.</li>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 2.png" alt=""
								style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
						</div>
						<li>There's a good mix of genders, but there are significantly more customers who are single
							than married.</li>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 3.png" alt=""
								style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
						</div>
						<li>Most customers have small family sizes (2-3), are educated, but here’s a twist – a lot of
							them are unemployed.</li>
						<li>Those who are employed tend to be earning less.</li>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 4.png" alt=""
								style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
						</div>
					</ul>
					<p>To visualize this, I created a dashboard with some cool charts and graphs. Because who doesn't
						love a good visual?</p>
					<h3>RFM Analysis - Or, How to Keep Customers Coming Back for More</h3>
					<p>I also used something called RFM analysis. It might sound technical, but it's actually pretty
						straightforward. It's all about:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Recency:</u> How recently someone placed an order.</li>
						<li><u>Frequency:</u> How often they order.</li>
						<li><u>Monetary:</u> How much they spend.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>By looking at these factors, we can segment customers even further and figure out the best ways
						to keep them engaged. It's like a restaurant knowing its regulars and what they love!</p>
					<h3>So What? (Why This Matters)</h3>
					<p>All this data is super useful for Zomato because it helps them:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Target their marketing:</u> Instead of blasting everyone with the same ads, they can
							tailor their messages to different groups.</li>
						<li><u>Boost sales:</u> By understanding customer behavior, they can offer the right promotions
							to the right people.</li>
						<li><u>Keep customers happy:</u> This is the ultimate goal! By providing personalized
							experiences, Zomato can turn one-time buyers into loyal fans.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Why This Matters to You (Potential Employer or Future Coworker)</h3>
					<p>This project shows I can:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Take raw data and turn it into something meaningful:</u> I'm not just about numbers; I'm
							about insights.</li>
						<li><u>Communicate complex stuff in a way that anyone can understand:</u> No jargon, just clear
							and concise info.</li>
						<li><u>Provide actionable recommendations:</u> I don't just identify problems; I offer
							solutions.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I'm excited to keep growing as a BI Analyst and tackle even more interesting challenges. As
						someone who tutors BI Analyst skills at TripleTen, I am continuously honing these skills. If
						you're looking for someone who's passionate about data and eager to learn, let's chat!</p>

					<h1>Shopify App</h1>
					<p>Uncovering the Secrets to e-Commercce Platforms</p>
				</header>
				<div class="box">
					<h3>Diving Deep into the Shopify App Store 🕵️‍♀️📊</h3>
					<p>In today's digital age, e-commerce platforms like Shopify have revolutionized how businesses
						operate. But with thousands of apps available in the Shopify App Store, how can developers
						ensure their app stands out and achieves success? 🤔 That's the question I tackled in my latest
						project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.</p>
					<h3>My Mission: Uncover the Keys to App Store Success 🔑</h3>
					<p>This project challenged me to analyze data scraped from the Shopify App Store to understand the
						app landscape and identify the factors that contribute to an app's popularity and positive
						reception. I utilized my Power BI skills to transform raw data into interactive dashboards and
						visualizations, revealing key insights.</p>
					<h3>Data Wrangling and Exploration 🧹</h3>
					<p>Data Wrangling and Exploration 🧹
						The project began with a raw Excel file containing information about various aspects of Shopify
						apps, including app details, categories, and user reviews. My first step was to familiarize
						myself with the data, clean any inconsistencies, and prepare it for analysis in Power BI. This
						involved joining different tables and ensuring data accuracy.</p>
					<h3>Visualizing the App Landscape 📊</h3>
					<p>With the data prepped, I harnessed the power of Power BI to create interactive dashboards. I
						focused on three key areas:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><u>App Store Landscape:</u> I used KPI cards and charts to visualize the overall
							distribution of apps, their categories, and their ratings. This provided a comprehensive
							overview of the app marketplace.</li>
						<li><u>Review Analysis:</u> I delved into the review data, using visualizations to understand
							user sentiment, identify trends in feedback, and analyze the impact of developer responses
							on app ratings.</li>
						<li><u>Developer Performance:</u> I analyzed app developers based on various metrics, such as
							average ratings, number of reviews, and responsiveness to user feedback. This allowed me to
							identify top-performing developers and understand their strategies.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Key Findings 🗝️</h3>
					<p>My analysis revealed several interesting insights:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New apps tend to receive more ratings early on, suggesting the importance of initial
							impressions.</li>
						<li>Most apps are rated favorably, indicating a generally positive user experience in the
							Shopify App Store.</li>
						<li>Developer responsiveness significantly impacts app ratings, with higher ratings for apps
							where developers actively engage with user reviews.</li>
						<li>Reviews marked as helpful by other users tend to have higher ratings, highlighting the
							importance of community feedback.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Insights for App Developers 💡</h3>
					<p>Based on my findings, I was able to provide valuable recommendations for Shopify app developers:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Prioritize early engagement with users to gather initial feedback and build a positive
							reputation.</li>
						<li>Actively respond to user reviews, demonstrating a commitment to customer satisfaction and
							continuous improvement.</li>
						<li>Focus on creating high-quality apps that address user needs and provide a positive
							experience.</li>
						<li>Encourage users to provide feedback and mark reviews as helpful to build community trust.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my Power BI skills to a real-world dataset and
						gain insights into the dynamics of the Shopify App Store. By transforming raw data into
						compelling visualizations, I was able to uncover valuable insights and provide actionable
						recommendations for app developers.</p>
