                    <h1>An E-Commerce Company</h1>
                    <p>A Business Analysis: Funnels & Cohorts</p>
                </header>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Cracking the E-Commerce Code: My Adventure in Data Decoding</h3>
                    <p>Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes at your favorite online stores? How do they know what
                        you like, what you might buy next, and why you sometimes abandon your shopping cart at the last
                        minute (we've all been there!)? Well, in my latest project for the TripleTen Business
                        Intelligence Analytics program, I got to play detective and uncover these secrets using the
                        power of data analysis!</p>
                    <p>This wasn't just any project—it was a deep dive into the world of e-commerce, where I transformed
                        raw website activity logs into juicy business insights. Think of it as turning a jumbled mess of
                        puzzle pieces into a clear picture of customer behavior.</p>
                    <h3>From Data Jungle to Data Playground</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a massive spreadsheet filled with every click, every view, and every purchase on an
                        e-commerce website. That was my starting point—a data jungle! My first task was to tame this
                        wilderness, filtering, cleaning, and organizing the data into something usable. It was like
                        going on a data safari, clearing paths and labeling everything along the way.</p>
                </div>

                    <img src="images/Blog/E-Commerce Jungle.png" alt=""
                        style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Building the Customer Journey: Funnels and Repeat Customers</h3>
                    <p>With the data tamed, I built two key tools to understand the customer journey:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>The Conversion Funnel - The Buyer's Adventure:</u> This funnel tracks the steps a
                            customer takes from discovering a product to actually buying it. It's like following a
                            breadcrumb trail! My analysis revealed a bit of a bottleneck: while many people added items
                            to their carts (a respectable 29% conversion rate), only 10% actually completed the
                            purchase. This was a big "aha!" moment, suggesting there might be issues with the checkout
                            process or product pages that need fixing. Maybe the shipping costs were a surprise, or the
                            checkout process was too complicated. Time to investigate!</li>
                        <li><u>Retention Rates - Will They Be Back?:</u> This metric tells you how many customers become
                            repeat buyers. I focused on a cohort of customers who made their first purchase in September
                            2020. The results? Not so great. After just one month, only 13% were still buying, and by
                            month four, it was down to a measly 3%. Ouch! This clearly showed a need for strategies to
                            keep customers coming back for more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>My Data-Driven Detective Work: Recommendations for Success</h3>
                    <p>Based on my data sleuthing, I presented the e-commerce company with some key recommendations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Conquer Cart Abandonment:</u> Those abandoned carts are like lost treasure! By figuring
                            out why people are leaving without buying, the company can make changes to the checkout
                            process and win back those potential sales.</li>
                        <li><u>Woo Repeat Customers:</u> Happy customers come back for more! Strategies like
                            personalized emails, loyalty programs, and top-notch customer support can turn one-time
                            buyers into loyal fans.</li>
                        <li><u>Ask the Customers!:</u> Sometimes, the best way to find out what's wrong is to just ask!
                            Gathering customer feedback through surveys or reviews can provide invaluable insights.</li>
                        <li><u>Keep Analyzing!:</u> Data analysis is an ongoing adventure. Regularly checking the data
                            keeps the company on track and helps it spot new opportunities and challenges.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This project was a blast! I got to use my business intelligence skills to turn raw data into a
                        compelling story and provide real, actionable advice for a business. It's like being a data
                        superhero, using numbers to save the day!</p>

                    <h1>The Zuber Database</h1>
                    <p>Using SQL to Analyze Taxi Rides in Chicago</p>
                </header>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>My SQL Adventure with the Zuber Database:</h3>
                    <p>Ever wondered what makes a taxi driver's day? Is it a sunny Saturday or a rainy Tuesday? Which
                        company reigns supreme in the Windy City? As part of my Business Intelligence Analytics training
                        with TripleTen, I dove headfirst into a project that aimed to answer these very questions, using
                        the magical powers of SQL!</p>
                    <p>Think of SQL as the secret language you use to chat with databases. It's how you ask them
                        questions and get them to spill their secrets. In this case, our database was a treasure trove
                        of Chicago taxi ride data – think of it as a digital diary of every trip, from pickup to
                        drop-off. </p>
                    <h3>Why did I embark on this data quest?</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you're running a ride-sharing app. Wouldn't it be awesome to know what customers want,
                        what affects their travel plans, and how your competitors are doing? That's exactly what this
                        project was about! By digging into the data, we could uncover hidden patterns and trends that
                        could help companies like Uber or Lyft make smarter decisions.</p>
                    <h3>My Mission:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Part 1: The Great Taxi Census:</u> I used SQL to count taxi rides for different companies
                            during specific periods. It was like conducting a census, but for taxis! I wanted to know
                            who was the most popular kid on the block. By grouping and sorting the data, I could easily
                            see which companies were racking up the rides. It was a bit like a taxi popularity contest!
                        </li>
                        <li><u>Part 2: Loop to O'Hare - The Weather Challenge:</u> This part was all about figuring out
                            if Mother Nature had a say in how long it took to get from the Loop to O'Hare. I played
                            detective, finding the neighborhood IDs for these locations and then checking the weather
                            records for each hour. I even created a simple weather rating system: "Good" for no rain or
                            storms and "Bad" for those less-than-ideal conditions. Then, I pulled up all the Saturday
                            rides between these two points, noting the weather and the ride duration. This allowed me to
                            see if a rainy Saturday meant a longer trip to the airport.</li>

                    <h3>The Tools of the Trade (aka SQL Commands):</h3>
                    <p>I used a few key SQL commands that acted like my trusty tools:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>SELECT:</u> To pick the specific information I wanted (like ride counts or weather
                            conditions).</li>
                        <li><u>WHERE:</u> To filter the data and focus on specific criteria (like rides on Saturdays).
                        </li>
                        <li><u>GROUP BY:</u> To organize the data into categories (like by company name).</li>
                        <li><u>ORDER BY:</u> To sort the results (like from most rides to least).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why This Matters (Beyond Just Numbers):</h3>
                    <p>This project wasn't just about crunching numbers. It was about using data to tell a story. By
                        analyzing the data, we could understand:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Customer Preferences:</u> Which taxi companies are the most popular? When do people tend
                            to travel?</li>
                        <li><u>External Influences:</u> How does the weather affect travel time?</li>
                        <li><u>Competitive Landscape:</u> How are different companies performing relative to each other?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
