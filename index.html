								<h1>CrewTracker Software Project</h1>
								<p>Migration and Merged Reports</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>From Legacy Reports to Interactive Dashboards</h3>
								<p>Data tells a story, but sometimes that story gets lost in translation. During my first foray into the professional world as a BI Analyst, I had the opportunity to help a company, 
									CrewTracker Software, rewrite their data narrative. They were wrestling with a common problem: an outdated reporting system that hindered their clients' ability to understand and act on 
									critical information. My team and I tackled this by migrating over 170 Crystal Reports to modern, interactive Power BI dashboards. This experience not only solidified my BI skills but also 
									highlighted the transformative power of effective data visualization.</p>
								<h3>The Crystal Reports Conundrum</h3>
								<p>CrewTracker Software provides solutions for managing field service operations. Like many established companies, they relied heavily on Crystal Reports, a legacy reporting tool. While 
									functional, Crystal Reports can be cumbersome, especially for complex data analysis and interactive exploration. Imagine trying to piece together a dynamic, 360-degree view of your business 
									from static, printed reports – that's the challenge CrewTracker's clients faced.</p>
								<p>Our mission was clear - modernize CrewTracker's reporting system by converting these static reports into dynamic, user-friendly Power BI dashboards. This would empower their clients to:</p>
								<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li>Effortlessly explore their data.</li>
									<li>Identify trends and patterns.</li>
									<li>Make data-driven decisions with confidence.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>A Three-Pronged Approach to Transformation</h3>
								<p>To efficiently tackle this large-scale migration, we adopted a three-tiered approach:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>First Responders: Extracting the Blueprint</li>
										<ul>
											<li>5 of our 20 externs had the first task - to dissect the existing Crystal Reports and document their key elements. This step was crucial "reverse engineering," laying the 
												groundwork for accurate replication in Power BI. This involved:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Connecting to the CrewTracker workstation via Remote Desktop Connection.</li>
													<li>Capturing screenshots of the report layout and field details.</li>
													<li>Exporting PDF views of the reports.</li>
													<li>Most importantly, extracting the underlying SQL queries and formula fields.</li>
												</ul>
											<li>As a First Responder, I personally cataloged 91 Crystal Reports.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Power BI Team: Building the Interactive Future</li>
										<ul>
											<li>All 20 externs joined the Power BI team. We were responsible for the core conversion and modernization work:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Translating the extracted SQL queries and formulas into Power BI.</li>
													<li>Designing interactive dashboards that went beyond the limitations of the original static reports.</li>
													<li>Creating merged reports, where appropriate, to consolidate information and provide a more holistic view.</li>
												</ul>
											<li> I successfully converted 3 Crystal Reports into a complex and interactive merged Power BI dashboard</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Peer Reviewers: Ensuring Accuracy and Quality</li>
										<ul>
											<li>To maintain quality, each Power BI report underwent rigorous peer review. This involved:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Verifying the accurate replication of the original report's layout and functionality.</li>
													<li>Confirming the accuracy of the SQL queries.</li>
													<li>Ensuring that all Crystal Report formula fields were correctly translated into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns.</li>
													<li>Assessing the overall completeness and purpose of the converted report.</li>
												</ul>
											<li>I contributed to this stage by peer-reviewing 9 Power BI reports, ensuring they met the high standards of accuracy and usability.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
								<h3>Diving Deeper: The Call List Merge Report</h3>
								<p>One of the most challenging and rewarding tasks was creating a merged Power BI dashboard for the "Call List" reports. This involved:</p>
								<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li>Consolidating SQL queries from three separate Crystal Reports into a single, optimized SQL Direct Query within Power BI.</li>
									<li>Designing a dashboard that accurately reflected the layout expectations of the original reports while leveraging Power BI's interactivity. This required careful consideration of how to 
										best represent the data and enable user exploration.</li>
									<li>Translating complex Crystal Report formula fields into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns. This was a critical step, as DAX provides powerful analytical capabilities but 
										requires a different syntax and approach than Crystal Reports formulas. I had to ensure that the formatting of these DAX calculations allowed for flexibility and future use.</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>Zomato Customer Analysis Segmentation</h1>
								<p>How I Used Data to Understand Zomato's Customers</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>Hey everyone!</h3>
								<p>So, It's been one year since I wrapped up a super interesting project analyzing Zomato's customer base, and I wanted to share how I dove into the data and what I found. If you don't know, Zomato is like the go-to app in India for anyone who loves food.</p>
								<p>As a budding BI Analyst, this project was a fantastic opportunity to flex my analytical muscles and uncover some tasty insights. This was the first project that I had complete control over from planning to presentation. My mission was to figure out who Zomato's customers are, how we can group them, and what makes them order all that delicious food.</p>
							<div class="image fit">
								<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 1.webp" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							</div>
								<h3>Data Dive - Not as Scary as it Sounds!</h3>
								<p>First things first, I had to get my hands dirty with the data. Luckily, the files weren’t huge, so I could use good ol’ spreadsheets to clean things up. Think of it as prepping your ingredients before cooking – essential, but not the main course.</p>
								<p>Then came the fun part: segmentation analysis. This is where we start grouping customers based on what they do and who they are. It's like sorting people into Hogwarts Houses to understand them better.</p>

								<h3>What I Found (The Fun Part)</h3>
								<p>Here's a little sneak peek into what I discovered:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Zomato's crowd is on the younger side, mostly around 23 years old, and a lot of them are single guys.</li>
							<div class="image fit">
								<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 2.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							</div>		
									<li>There's a good mix of genders, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.</li>
							<div class="image fit">
								<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 3.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							</div>		
									<li>Most customers have small family sizes (2-3), are educated, but here’s a twist – a lot of them are unemployed.</li>
									<li>Those who are employed tend to be earning less.</li>
							<div class="image fit">
								<img src="images/Blog/Zomato 4.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							</div>		
								</ul>
								<p>To visualize this, I created a dashboard with some cool charts and graphs. Because who doesn't love a good visual?</p>
								<h3>RFM Analysis - Or, How to Keep Customers Coming Back for More</h3>
								<p>I also used something called RFM analysis. It might sound technical, but it's actually pretty straightforward. It's all about:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Recency:</u>  How recently someone placed an order.</li>
									<li><u>Frequency:</u> How often they order.</li>
									<li><u>Monetary:</u>  How much they spend.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>By looking at these factors, we can segment customers even further and figure out the best ways to keep them engaged. It's like a restaurant knowing its regulars and what they love!</p>
								<h3>So What? (Why This Matters)</h3>
								<p>All this data is super useful for Zomato because it helps them:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Target their marketing:</u>  Instead of blasting everyone with the same ads, they can tailor their messages to different groups.</li>
									<li><u>Boost sales:</u> By understanding customer behavior, they can offer the right promotions to the right people.</li>
									<li><u>Keep customers happy:</u>  This is the ultimate goal! By providing personalized experiences, Zomato can turn one-time buyers into loyal fans.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Why This Matters to You (Potential Employer or Future Coworker)</h3>
								<p>This project shows I can:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Take raw data and turn it into something meaningful:</u>  I'm not just about numbers; I'm about insights.</li>
									<li><u>Communicate complex stuff in a way that anyone can understand:</u> No jargon, just clear and concise info.</li>
									<li><u>Provide actionable recommendations:</u>  I don't just identify problems; I offer solutions.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>I'm excited to keep growing as a BI Analyst and tackle even more interesting challenges. As someone who tutors BI Analyst skills at TripleTen, I am continuously honing these skills. If you're looking for someone who's passionate about data and eager to learn, let's chat!</p>

								<h1>SuperStore Returns Analysis</h1>
								<p>A Deep Dive into Data Storytelling Using Tableau</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>Superstore's Return Problem</h3>
								<p>In my previous project, I acted as a data consultant for Superstore, analyzing their overall sales and profitability. One major issue I uncovered was an alarmingly high rate of product returns. So, I decided to take a closer look, focusing specifically on returns and using Tableau to tell a compelling data story for Superstore's CEO. This was my fifth project in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, and it was all about honing my skills in creating impactful dashboards and presentations.</p>

								<h3>From Data to Narrative - The Power of Storytelling</h3>
								<p>This time, my goal wasn't just to present numbers; it was to craft a narrative that would resonate with the CEO and drive action. I wanted to answer the crucial questions: Why are customers returning so many products, and what can Superstore do about it?</p>
								<p>I started with the same dataset as before—a spreadsheet containing detailed information on orders and returns. After joining the relevant data, I dove into the analysis, using Tableau to visualize the data from different angles.</p>
								
								<h3>Uncovering the Return Culprits</h3>
								<p>Through my visualizations, several key factors contributing to the high return rates emerged:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Problem Customers:</u> I discovered several customers with exceptionally high return rates, some even returning 100% of their purchases. This suggested potential issues with customer expectations, product suitability, or even potential fraud.</li>
									<li><u>Problem Products:</u> Similarly, certain products were returned at an unusually high rate, indicating potential problems with product quality, descriptions, or sizing information.</li>
									<li><u>Location, Location, Location:</u> Geographic analysis revealed that certain states, particularly Utah, had significantly higher return rates than others. This hinted at possible regional differences in customer preferences, shipping issues, or other location-specific factors.</li>
									<li><u>Seasonal Spikes:</u> I also found that returns spiked in August and September, following a period of increased purchases. This suggested a connection between promotional periods or seasonal buying habits and returns.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Recommendations for a Return-Free Future (Almost!)</h3>
								<p>Based on these findings, I presented the CEO with the following recommendations, packaged in a clear and compelling Tableau story:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Targeted Employee Training:</u>  I suggested providing additional training to the technology department to better assist customers in selecting the right products. This could involve improving product knowledge, providing better online resources, or offering personalized recommendations.</li>
									<li><u>Customer Outreach:</u> For customers with 100% return rates, I recommended direct outreach to understand the reasons behind their returns. This feedback could provide valuable insights into systemic issues and inform necessary changes to the website, shipping processes, or other areas.</li>
									<li><u>Immediate Action on Problem Products:</u> As a triage measure, I recommended immediately halting sales of the products with consistently high return rates. This would stop the bleeding and allow time for a more thorough investigation.</li>
									<li><u>Proactive Product Information Improvements:</u> I suggested a focused effort to improve product information, including more detailed descriptions, accurate size guides, and encouraging customer reviews through social media collaborations. This would help customers make more informed purchasing decisions and reduce the likelihood of returns.</li>
									<li><u>Policy and Promotion Adjustments:</u> Finally, I recommended considering stricter return policies or implementing return fees for purchases made in problematic states. I also suggested adjusting promotional strategies, perhaps shifting from discounts to value-added offers like free shipping, especially during peak seasons.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>The Power of Data Storytelling</h3>
								<p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase not just my data analysis skills but also my ability to communicate complex information effectively through data storytelling. By creating a compelling narrative with clear visualizations, I aimed to provide Superstore's CEO with the insights needed to make informed decisions and address their return problem.</p>

								<h1>SuperStore Consult</h1>
								<p>Using Tableau to Avoid bankruptcy</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>Superstore on the Brink - My Data-Driven Rescue Mission!</h3>
								<p>Picture this: a bustling store, shelves overflowing with products, but the cash registers are singing a sad, empty tune. That was the predicament facing Superstore in my latest project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. I stepped into the role of a data-savvy consultant, armed with the power of Tableau to diagnose their financial woes and prescribe a data-driven cure.</p>
								<h3>From Spreadsheet Chaos to Visual Clarity</h3>
								<p>My adventure began with a massive Excel spreadsheet—a data goldmine, but in its raw form, it was a bit like a tangled ball of yarn. My first order of business was to untangle that yarn, joining different datasets and organizing the information into a usable format. Think of it as preparing the ingredients for a delicious data dish!</p>
								<h3>Tableau Time - Turning Numbers into Narratives</h3>
								<p>With the data prepped and ready, I unleashed the magic of Tableau, a fantastic data visualization tool. This is where the real fun began! I transformed rows and columns of numbers into engaging charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that told a compelling story. Here's what I uncovered:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Profit Hotspots and Cold Zones:</u> I zoomed in on different product categories and regions to pinpoint where Superstore was making money and where they were losing it. It turned out that Office Supplies and Technology were the heroes in the West Region, while Furniture was dragging down profits in the Central Region. Some product subcategories, like Copiers, Phones, and Accessories, were consistent winners, while others, like Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies, were consistently underperforming. It was like discovering hidden treasure and uncovering hidden traps!</li>
									<li><u>Advertising Alchemy:</u> I analyzed sales trends over time to identify the sweet spots for advertising. Turns out, timing is everything! I recommended focusing advertising efforts in Indiana during October (spooky good deals!), Vermont during November (pre-holiday shopping frenzy!), and Washington during March (spring cleaning bonanza!).</li>
									<li><u>The Return of the Returns:</u> This was the biggest "uh-oh" moment of the analysis. Product returns were a major drain on profits, with some products seeing return rates as high as 100%! Yikes! I also identified some customers who seemed to be professional returners. Time to investigate!</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>My Data-Driven Prescription for Profitability</h3>
								<p>Based on my data-driven detective work, I presented Superstore with a set of recommendations to get them back in the black:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Fuel the Fire:</u> Keep investing in the profitable product categories and regions. Don't fix what ain't broken!</li>
									<li><u>Address the Duds:</u> For the loss-generating areas, it's time for some serious soul-searching. Are the products priced wrong? Is there a quality issue? Should they be discontinued altogether? It's time to make some tough decisions.</li>
									<li><u>Smart Advertising, Not Just More Advertising:</u> Targeted campaigns are key! By focusing on the right time and the right place, Superstore can get more bang for their advertising buck.</li>
									<li><u>Tame the Returns:</u> High return rates are a red flag. Investigating the root causes and implementing strategies to reduce returns is essential. Maybe it's time for clearer product descriptions, better quality control, or a review of the return policy.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to see how data visualization can transform a struggling business. By turning raw data into clear and engaging visuals, I gave Superstore the insights they needed to chart a course toward a profitable future.</p>

								<h1>An E-Commerce Company</h1>
								<p>A Business Analysis: Funnels & Cohorts</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>Cracking the E-Commerce Code: My Adventure in Data Decoding</h3>
								<p>Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes at your favorite online stores? How do they know what you like, what you might buy next, and why you sometimes abandon your shopping cart at the last minute (we've all been there!)? Well, in my latest project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, I got to play detective and uncover these secrets using the power of data analysis!</p>
								<p>This wasn't just any project—it was a deep dive into the world of e-commerce, where I transformed raw website activity logs into juicy business insights. Think of it as turning a jumbled mess of puzzle pieces into a clear picture of customer behavior.</p>
								<h3>From Data Jungle to Data Playground</h3>
								<p>Imagine a massive spreadsheet filled with every click, every view, and every purchase on an e-commerce website. That was my starting point—a data jungle! My first task was to tame this wilderness, filtering, cleaning, and organizing the data into something usable. It was like going on a data safari, clearing paths and labeling everything along the way.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>Building the Customer Journey: Funnels and Repeat Customers</h3>
								<p>With the data tamed, I built two key tools to understand the customer journey:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>The Conversion Funnel - The Buyer's Adventure:</u> This funnel tracks the steps a customer takes from discovering a product to actually buying it. It's like following a breadcrumb trail! My analysis revealed a bit of a bottleneck: while many people added items to their carts (a respectable 29% conversion rate), only 10% actually completed the purchase. This was a big "aha!" moment, suggesting there might be issues with the checkout process or product pages that need fixing. Maybe the shipping costs were a surprise, or the checkout process was too complicated. Time to investigate!</li>
									<li><u>Retention Rates - Will They Be Back?:</u> This metric tells you how many customers become repeat buyers. I focused on a cohort of customers who made their first purchase in September 2020. The results? Not so great. After just one month, only 13% were still buying, and by month four, it was down to a measly 3%. Ouch! This clearly showed a need for strategies to keep customers coming back for more.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>My Data-Driven Detective Work: Recommendations for Success</h3>
								<p>Based on my data sleuthing, I presented the e-commerce company with some key recommendations:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Conquer Cart Abandonment:</u>  Those abandoned carts are like lost treasure! By figuring out why people are leaving without buying, the company can make changes to the checkout process and win back those potential sales.</li>
									<li><u>Woo Repeat Customers:</u> Happy customers come back for more! Strategies like personalized emails, loyalty programs, and top-notch customer support can turn one-time buyers into loyal fans.</li>
									<li><u>Ask the Customers!:</u> Sometimes, the best way to find out what's wrong is to just ask! Gathering customer feedback through surveys or reviews can provide invaluable insights.</li>
									<li><u>Keep Analyzing!:</u> Data analysis is an ongoing adventure. Regularly checking the data keeps the company on track and helps it spot new opportunities and challenges.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This project was a blast! I got to use my business intelligence skills to turn raw data into a compelling story and provide real, actionable advice for a business. It's like being a data superhero, using numbers to save the day!</p>

								<h1>The Zuber Database</h1>
								<p>Using SQL to Analyze Taxi Rides in Chicago</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>My SQL Adventure with the Zuber Database:</h3>
								<p>Ever wondered what makes a taxi driver's day? Is it a sunny Saturday or a rainy Tuesday? Which company reigns supreme in the Windy City? As part of my Business Intelligence Analytics training with TripleTen, I dove headfirst into a project that aimed to answer these very questions, using the magical powers of SQL!</p>
								<p>Think of SQL as the secret language you use to chat with databases. It's how you ask them questions and get them to spill their secrets. In this case, our database was a treasure trove of Chicago taxi ride data – think of it as a digital diary of every trip, from pickup to drop-off. </p>
								<h3>Why did I embark on this data quest?</h3>
								<p>Imagine you're running a ride-sharing app. Wouldn't it be awesome to know what customers want, what affects their travel plans, and how your competitors are doing? That's exactly what this project was about! By digging into the data, we could uncover hidden patterns and trends that could help companies like Uber or Lyft make smarter decisions.</p>
								<h3>My Mission:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Part 1: The Great Taxi Census:</u>  I used SQL to count taxi rides for different companies during specific periods. It was like conducting a census, but for taxis! I wanted to know who was the most popular kid on the block. By grouping and sorting the data, I could easily see which companies were racking up the rides. It was a bit like a taxi popularity contest!</li>
									<li><u>Part 2: Loop to O'Hare - The Weather Challenge:</u> This part was all about figuring out if Mother Nature had a say in how long it took to get from the Loop to O'Hare. I played detective, finding the neighborhood IDs for these locations and then checking the weather records for each hour. I even created a simple weather rating system: "Good" for no rain or storms and "Bad" for those less-than-ideal conditions. Then, I pulled up all the Saturday rides between these two points, noting the weather and the ride duration. This allowed me to see if a rainy Saturday meant a longer trip to the airport.</li>
								</ul>

								<img src="images/Blog/Zuber Database1.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
							</div>
								<h3>The Tools of the Trade (aka SQL Commands):</h3>
								<p>I used a few key SQL commands that acted like my trusty tools:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>SELECT:</u> To pick the specific information I wanted (like ride counts or weather conditions).</li>
									<li><u>WHERE:</u> To filter the data and focus on specific criteria (like rides on Saturdays).</li>
									<li><u>GROUP BY:</u> To organize the data into categories (like by company name).</li>
									<li><u>ORDER BY:</u> To sort the results (like from most rides to least).</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Click the image to see all of the query's</p>
								<h3>Why This Matters (Beyond Just Numbers):</h3>
								<p>This project wasn't just about crunching numbers. It was about using data to tell a story. By analyzing the data, we could understand:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Customer Preferences:</u> Which taxi companies are the most popular? When do people tend to travel?</li>
									<li><u>External Influences:</u> How does the weather affect travel time?</li>
									<li><u>Competitive Landscape:</u> How are different companies performing relative to each other?</li>
