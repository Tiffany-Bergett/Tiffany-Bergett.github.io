									<h3>Let me introduce myself properly</h3>
									<p>Hi there! I'm Tiffany. Beyond the world of data, I'm a mom to two wonderful kids, a friend to many, and a partner to one amazing person. They're my 'why' and a constant reminder of the human side of everything we do.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3>A Career Reimagined</h3>
									<p>In 2020, the global pandemic brought my previous career to an unexpected halt. Like many, I was laid off and found myself at a crossroads. That moment of uncertainty became a silver lining—an opportunity to reflect, redefine my path, and build something new. </p>
									<p>My Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, earned long before my career transition, taught me to be relentlessly curious about human behavior. It trained me to ask "why"—to look beyond the surface and understand the motivations behind actions. </p>
									<p>I decided to pivot into data analytics. I discovered it was the perfect toolkit to find the answers. It allows me to apply the same principles of inquiry and discovery from psychology.</p>
									<p>With this clear vision, I took action. I enrolled in a rigorous business intelligence bootcamp to master the technical toolset, including SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. It was there that I discovered my true passion: transforming raw data into the compelling visual stories that empower businesses to make smarter decisions.</p>
									<p>Since then, I've learned Python, about AI, and participated in Externships. To continue building on that momentum, I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology. This advanced degree is deepening my expertise in the systems and strategies that power modern businesses, ensuring I can solve not just today's challenges, but help manage tomorrow's as well.</p>
									<h3>Driven by a Desire to Help</h3>
									<p>My journey isn't just about changing jobs; it's about aligning my work with my core values. I'm driven by a strong desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. I've dedicated time to various volunteer roles, including supporting hospice patients, mentoring students, and assisting with community health initiatives. These experiences have not only enriched my life but also instilled in me the value of empathy, compassion, and teamwork. I believe these qualities are essential for fostering positive relationships and contributing to a supportive and collaborative work environment. I bring that same sense of empathy to every dataset I analyze and every team I work with.</p>
									<h3>When I'm Not at the Keyboard</h3>
									<p>When I step away from the data, you can usually find me enjoying outdoor adventures, getting lost in a good book, diving into video games, or working on a new craft project. These hobbies help me stay creative, curious, and balanced.</p>

								<h3>From Catch-22 to a Master in Tech </h3>
                                <p>The Catch-22 of the job market is all too familiar: you need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience. After a challenging search for an entry-level role, I found my way to <a href="https://www.extern.com" target="_blank"><strong>Extern.com</strong></a>, a platform that promised to solve this very problem. What followed was a project that not only gave me a portfolio piece but also changed my career trajectory and cemented my love for tech.</p>
                                <p>This is the story of my Externship with a major tech company, working on a project with a strong focus on Market & Competitor Analysis for Beats by Dre.</p>

                                <h3>Decoding the Wireless Speaker Market</h3>
                                <p>My project began with a core business challenge: "What are the key factors driving consumer interest in high-fidelity wireless speakers, and how do evolving preferences influence this market?"</p>
                                <p>This wasn't just a theoretical exercise. It was a real-world problem for a global brand, and it was my job to find the answers. To tackle this, I needed to go beyond what I learned in my boot camp and dive into new skills and tools.</p>

                                <h3>My Methodical Approach</h3>
                                <p>This project was a true test of my skills, taking me from the foundational stages to a final, strategic deliverable.</p>
                                <ol style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li>Foundational Research & Planning</li>
                                        <p>I started by getting into the mind of the customer. I used frameworks like <strong>AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)</strong> to create a customer journey map and an ideal consumer profile. This step was crucial for ensuring that my analysis would be human-centric and focused on a real business problem.</p>
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src="images/Blog/BBDBlog1.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

                                    <li>Data Acquisition & Analysis</h4>
                                        <p>With the groundwork laid, I dived into the data. I used <strong>Python</strong> to scrape and clean a massive dataset of nearly 5,000 Survey responses and Amazon reviews for key Beats by Dre competitors like JBL, Bose, Sony, and Marshall. This was my first time working with messy, real-world data, and I leveraged libraries like <strong>Pandas & Numpy</strong> to prepare it for analysis.</p>
                                        <p>I then moved on to <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>, using <strong>Matplotlib</strong> and <strong>Seaborn</strong> to visualize trends. I analyzed review lengths, ratings, and common keywords to find initial patterns.</p>
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src="images/Blog/BBDBlog2.PNG" alt="" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

                                    <li>Advanced Insights with AI</h4>
                                        <p>The most exciting part of this project was applying advanced techniques and modern tools to gain a deeper understanding of the data. To get started, I imported a full suite of Python libraries for my analysis, including:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): </strong>A powerful platform for working with human language data, which was essential for preparing the text for analysis.</li>
                                            <li><strong>textblob: </strong>A library for performing sentiment analysis and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</li>
                                            <li><strong>wordcloud: </strong>To visually represent the most common words in customer reviews.</li>
                                            <li><strong>google.generativeai (Gemini API): </strong>An advanced AI tool used to perform qualitative analysis and summarize key takeaways from the sentiment analysis.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>I also leveraged AI tools like <strong>Gamma & Claude</strong> for a presentation slide-deck and dashboard creation. This felt like the "next tier" of learning, as I explored advanced prompting techniques to find hidden insights in open-ended survey responses and build a dynamic dashboard.</p>
                                </ol>

								<h1>CrewTracker Software Project</h1>
								<p>Migration and Merged Reports</p>
							</header>
							<div class="box">
								<h3>From Legacy Reports to Interactive Dashboards</h3>
								<p>Data tells a story, but sometimes that story gets lost in translation. During my first foray into the professional world as a BI Analyst, I had the opportunity to help a company, 
									CrewTracker Software, rewrite their data narrative. They were wrestling with a common problem: an outdated reporting system that hindered their clients' ability to understand and act on 
									critical information. My team and I tackled this by migrating over 170 Crystal Reports to modern, interactive Power BI dashboards. This experience not only solidified my BI skills but also 
									highlighted the transformative power of effective data visualization.</p>
								<h3>The Crystal Reports Conundrum</h3>
								<p>CrewTracker Software provides solutions for managing field service operations. Like many established companies, they relied heavily on Crystal Reports, a legacy reporting tool. While 
									functional, Crystal Reports can be cumbersome, especially for complex data analysis and interactive exploration. Imagine trying to piece together a dynamic, 360-degree view of your business 
									from static, printed reports – that's the challenge CrewTracker's clients faced.</p>
								<p>Our mission was clear - modernize CrewTracker's reporting system by converting these static reports into dynamic, user-friendly Power BI dashboards. This would empower their clients to:</p>
								<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li>Effortlessly explore their data.</li>
									<li>Identify trends and patterns.</li>
									<li>Make data-driven decisions with confidence.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>A Three-Pronged Approach to Transformation</h3>
								<p>To efficiently tackle this large-scale migration, we adopted a three-tiered approach:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>First Responders: Extracting the Blueprint</li>
										<ul>
											<li>5 of our 20 externs had the first task - to dissect the existing Crystal Reports and document their key elements. This step was crucial "reverse engineering," laying the 
												groundwork for accurate replication in Power BI. This involved:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Connecting to the CrewTracker workstation via Remote Desktop Connection.</li>
													<li>Capturing screenshots of the report layout and field details.</li>
													<li>Exporting PDF views of the reports.</li>
													<li>Most importantly, extracting the underlying SQL queries and formula fields.</li>
												</ul>
											<li>As a First Responder, I personally cataloged 91 Crystal Reports.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Power BI Team: Building the Interactive Future</li>
										<ul>
											<li>All 20 externs joined the Power BI team. We were responsible for the core conversion and modernization work:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Translating the extracted SQL queries and formulas into Power BI.</li>
													<li>Designing interactive dashboards that went beyond the limitations of the original static reports.</li>
													<li>Creating merged reports, where appropriate, to consolidate information and provide a more holistic view.</li>
												</ul>
											<li> I successfully converted 3 Crystal Reports into a complex and interactive merged Power BI dashboard</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Peer Reviewers: Ensuring Accuracy and Quality</li>
										<ul>
											<li>To maintain quality, each Power BI report underwent rigorous peer review. This involved:</li>
												<ul style="padding-left: 60px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
													<li>Verifying the accurate replication of the original report's layout and functionality.</li>
													<li>Confirming the accuracy of the SQL queries.</li>
													<li>Ensuring that all Crystal Report formula fields were correctly translated into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns.</li>
													<li>Assessing the overall completeness and purpose of the converted report.</li>
												</ul>
											<li>I contributed to this stage by peer-reviewing 9 Power BI reports, ensuring they met the high standards of accuracy and usability.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
								<h3>Diving Deeper: The Call List Merge Report</h3>
								<p>One of the most challenging and rewarding tasks was creating a merged Power BI dashboard for the "Call List" reports. This involved:</p>
								<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li>Consolidating SQL queries from three separate Crystal Reports into a single, optimized SQL Direct Query within Power BI.</li>
									<li>Designing a dashboard that accurately reflected the layout expectations of the original reports while leveraging Power BI's interactivity. This required careful consideration of how to 
										best represent the data and enable user exploration.</li>
									<li>Translating complex Crystal Report formula fields into Power BI DAX measures and calculated columns. This was a critical step, as DAX provides powerful analytical capabilities but 
										requires a different syntax and approach than Crystal Reports formulas. I had to ensure that the formatting of these DAX calculations allowed for flexibility and future use.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Key Insights</h3>
								<p>This project yielded significant insights into the power of modern BI tools:</p>
								<ul style="padding-left: 40px; margin-left: 0;"></ulstyle>
									<li><u>Enhanced Data Accessibility:</u> Power BI dashboards provide a more intuitive and interactive way for users to explore data compared to static Crystal Reports.</li>
									<li><u>Improved Data Visualization:</u> Interactive dashboards allow for dynamic filtering, drilling down into details, and visualizing trends, leading to better understanding and faster 
										decision-making.</li>
									<li><u>Increased Efficiency:</u> By consolidating reports and automating data refreshes, Power BI can streamline reporting processes and save time.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Results: Empowering CrewTracker's Clients</h3>
