                    <h1>Animation Movies</h1>
                    <p>A Post-Bootcamp Competition Story</p>
                </header>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>How a 4-day data competition bridged the gap between theory and practice. </h3>
                    <p>Shortly after finishing my data analytics bootcamp last year, I dove headfirst into one of my
                        first real challenges: a 4-day, team-based data visualization competition hosted by TripleTen
                        using data from Kaggle. The setup was simple but intense. </p>
                    <p>Our team of three was given five datasets and one open-ended prompt: find a compelling story and
                        prepare to present it live on YouTube. We immediately had a hunch that the Spotify dataset would
                        be the most popular choice. To stand out, we made a strategic decision to go against the grain.
                        We chose a dataset that sparked our creativity: 80 years of animated movies. This project was
                        the ultimate test of our new skills, forcing us to quickly move from raw data to a polished,
                        public-facing presentation. It was a high-speed crash course in the real-world workflow of a BI
                        team.</p>

                    <h3>From Brainstorm:</h2>
                        <p>With the clock ticking, our teamâ€™s first task was to define our project. We brainstormed
                            questions a studio executive might ask to gain a competitive edge. We focused on three core
                            questions to guide our analysis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which studios have truly dominated the animation industry over the years?</li>
                            <li>How has the very nature of these films (like runtime) evolved?</li>
                            <li>Does a bigger budget actually guarantee a better audience rating?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>From Python:</h3>
                        <p>Our workflow was a perfect simulation of how a modern data team operates, blending different
                            skills to achieve a single goal.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Collaborative Data Cleaning:</strong> Our team's first hurdle was the data
                                itself. One of my teammates handled the initial prep using Python to efficiently wrangle
                                the messy dataset, creating a pristine file for us to work with.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visualization and Storytelling in Tableau:</strong> With the clean data ready,
                                we imported it into Tableau, which became our command center. This is where my BI skills
                                came to life. I focused on building the core visualizations like bar charts, line
                                graphs, and scatter plots that would form the foundation of our narrative.</li>
                            <li><strong>Building the Narrative in a Story:</strong> We arranged our finished
                                visualizations into cohesive dashboards. Then, using Tableau's Story feature, we
                                sequenced our dashboards into a step-by-step narrative that would walk our audience and
                                the judges through our discovery process.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>The Discoveries:</h3>
                        <p>Our Tableau dashboard revealed several clear and impactful insights that became the
                            centerpiece of our live presentation.</p>

                        <h4>Insight 1: A Genre Showdown Through the Decades</h4>
                        <p>Our analysis of genre trends revealed a fascinating shift in audience taste over time. We
                            created a line chart tracking the most produced genres for each decade, which clearly showed
                            that Comedy was the undisputed king of animation until the 1970s. From that point on, Family
                            films took over as the dominant genre. Our data also captured a surprising anomaly: a brief
                            but sharp spike in Documentaries right at the beginning of the pandemic, reflecting a unique
                            moment in viewing history.</p>

                            <img src="images/Blog/AM1.PNG" alt=""
                                style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        </div>

                        <h4>Insight 2: We're Watching Longer Movies</h4>
                        <p>A line chart tracking the average runtime of animated films per decade revealed a distinct
                            upward trend, showing how storytelling and audience expectations have evolved from the
                            75-minute features of the 1940s to the 100+ minute epics of today.</p>
                        <div class="image fit">
                            <img src="images/Blog/AM2.PNG" alt=""
                                style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        </div>

                        <h4>Insight 3: Bigger Budgets, Bigger Box Office</h4>
                        <p>Our final Tableau scatter plot mapped production budgets against total revenue and delivered
                            a critical business insight: there was a strong positive correlation. This visual was key in
                            our presentation. It demonstrated that, generally, as a studio's investment in a film
                            increases, so does the potential for higher box office revenue. For an executive, this
                            reinforces the strategy that larger investments in tent-pole animated features are a sound
                            financial bet.</p>
                        <div class="image fit">
                            <img src="images/Blog/AM3.PNG" alt=""
                                style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        </div>

                        <h3>To Infinity!:</h3>
                        <p>Presenting our Tableau story live on YouTube was a nerve-wracking but incredibly rewarding
                            experience. This competition, coming so soon after my bootcamp, was a crucial bridge between
                            theory and practice.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            It taught me the vital rhythm of a BI project: taking the clean data from an analyst, diving
                            deep into it with a tool like Tableau, and emerging with a clear, compelling story that can
                            inform and persuade an audience.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>It solidified that this is exactly where my skills shine. My psychology background pushes me
                            to find the 'why' in the data, and my BI training allows me to build the story that delivers
                            the answer.</p>

                <header class="major" style="text-align: center;">
                    <h1>SuperStore Returns Analysis</h1>
                    <p>A Deep Dive into Data Storytelling Using Tableau</p>
                </header>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Superstore's Return Problem</h3>
                    <p>In my previous project, I acted as a data consultant for Superstore, analyzing their overall
                        sales and profitability. One major issue I uncovered was an alarmingly high rate of product
                        returns. So, I decided to take a closer look, focusing specifically on returns and using Tableau
                        to tell a compelling data story for Superstore's CEO. This was my fifth project in the TripleTen
                        Business Intelligence Analytics program, and it was all about honing my skills in creating
                        impactful dashboards and presentations.</p>

                    <h3>From Data to Narrative - The Power of Storytelling</h3>
                    <p>This time, my goal wasn't just to present numbers; it was to craft a narrative that would
                        resonate with the CEO and drive action. I wanted to answer the crucial questions: Why are
                        customers returning so many products, and what can Superstore do about it?</p>
                    <p>I started with the same dataset as beforeâ€”a spreadsheet containing detailed information on orders
                        and returns. After joining the relevant data, I dove into the analysis, using Tableau to
                        visualize the data from different angles.</p>

                    <h3>Uncovering the Return Culprits</h3>
                    <p>Through my visualizations, several key factors contributing to the high return rates emerged:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Problem Customers:</u> I discovered several customers with exceptionally high return
                            rates, some even returning 100% of their purchases. This suggested potential issues with
                            customer expectations, product suitability, or even potential fraud.</li>
                        <li><u>Problem Products:</u> Similarly, certain products were returned at an unusually high
                            rate, indicating potential problems with product quality, descriptions, or sizing
                            information.</li>
                        <li><u>Location, Location, Location:</u> Geographic analysis revealed that certain states,
                            particularly Utah, had significantly higher return rates than others. This hinted at
                            possible regional differences in customer preferences, shipping issues, or other
                            location-specific factors.</li>
                        <li><u>Seasonal Spikes:</u> I also found that returns spiked in August and September, following
                            a period of increased purchases. This suggested a connection between promotional periods or
                            seasonal buying habits and returns.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Recommendations for a Return-Free Future (Almost!)</h3>
                    <p>Based on these findings, I presented the CEO with the following recommendations, packaged in a
                        clear and compelling Tableau story:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Targeted Employee Training:</u> I suggested providing additional training to the
                            technology department to better assist customers in selecting the right products. This could
                            involve improving product knowledge, providing better online resources, or offering
                            personalized recommendations.</li>
                        <li><u>Customer Outreach:</u> For customers with 100% return rates, I recommended direct
                            outreach to understand the reasons behind their returns. This feedback could provide
                            valuable insights into systemic issues and inform necessary changes to the website, shipping
                            processes, or other areas.</li>
                        <li><u>Immediate Action on Problem Products:</u> As a triage measure, I recommended immediately
                            halting sales of the products with consistently high return rates. This would stop the
                            bleeding and allow time for a more thorough investigation.</li>
                        <li><u>Proactive Product Information Improvements:</u> I suggested a focused effort to improve
                            product information, including more detailed descriptions, accurate size guides, and
                            encouraging customer reviews through social media collaborations. This would help customers
                            make more informed purchasing decisions and reduce the likelihood of returns.</li>
                        <li><u>Policy and Promotion Adjustments:</u> Finally, I recommended considering stricter return
                            policies or implementing return fees for purchases made in problematic states. I also
                            suggested adjusting promotional strategies, perhaps shifting from discounts to value-added
                            offers like free shipping, especially during peak seasons.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Power of Data Storytelling</h3>
                    <p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase not just my data analysis skills but also my
                        ability to communicate complex information effectively through data storytelling. By creating a
                        compelling narrative with clear visualizations, I aimed to provide Superstore's CEO with the
                        insights needed to make informed decisions and address their return problem.</p>

                    <p>Using Tableau to Avoid bankruptcy</p>
                </header>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Superstore on the Brink - My Data-Driven Rescue Mission!</h3>
                    <p>Picture this: a bustling store, shelves overflowing with products, but the cash registers are
                        singing a sad, empty tune. That was the predicament facing Superstore in my latest project for
                        the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. I stepped into the role of a data-savvy
                        consultant, armed with the power of Tableau to diagnose their financial woes and prescribe a
                        data-driven cure.</p>
                    <h3>From Spreadsheet Chaos to Visual Clarity</h3>
                    <p>My adventure began with a massive Excel spreadsheetâ€”a data goldmine, but in its raw form, it was
                        a bit like a tangled ball of yarn. My first order of business was to untangle that yarn, joining
                        different datasets and organizing the information into a usable format. Think of it as preparing
                        the ingredients for a delicious data dish!</p>
                    <h3>Tableau Time - Turning Numbers into Narratives</h3>
                    <p>With the data prepped and ready, I unleashed the magic of Tableau, a fantastic data visualization
                        tool. This is where the real fun began! I transformed rows and columns of numbers into engaging
                        charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that told a compelling story. Here's what I
                        uncovered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Profit Hotspots and Cold Zones:</u> I zoomed in on different product categories and
                            regions to pinpoint where Superstore was making money and where they were losing it. It
                            turned out that Office Supplies and Technology were the heroes in the West Region, while
                            Furniture was dragging down profits in the Central Region. Some product subcategories, like
                            Copiers, Phones, and Accessories, were consistent winners, while others, like Tables,
                            Bookcases, and Supplies, were consistently underperforming. It was like discovering hidden
                            treasure and uncovering hidden traps!</li>
                        <li><u>Advertising Alchemy:</u> I analyzed sales trends over time to identify the sweet spots
                            for advertising. Turns out, timing is everything! I recommended focusing advertising efforts
                            in Indiana during October (spooky good deals!), Vermont during November (pre-holiday
                            shopping frenzy!), and Washington during March (spring cleaning bonanza!).</li>
                        <li><u>The Return of the Returns:</u> This was the biggest "uh-oh" moment of the analysis.
                            Product returns were a major drain on profits, with some products seeing return rates as
                            high as 100%! Yikes! I also identified some customers who seemed to be professional
                            returners. Time to investigate!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>My Data-Driven Prescription for Profitability</h3>
                    <p>Based on my data-driven detective work, I presented Superstore with a set of recommendations to
                        get them back in the black:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Fuel the Fire:</u> Keep investing in the profitable product categories and regions. Don't
                            fix what ain't broken!</li>
                        <li><u>Address the Duds:</u> For the loss-generating areas, it's time for some serious
                            soul-searching. Are the products priced wrong? Is there a quality issue? Should they be
                            discontinued altogether? It's time to make some tough decisions.</li>
                        <li><u>Smart Advertising, Not Just More Advertising:</u> Targeted campaigns are key! By focusing
                            on the right time and the right place, Superstore can get more bang for their advertising
                            buck.</li>
                        <li><u>Tame the Returns:</u> High return rates are a red flag. Investigating the root causes and
                            implementing strategies to reduce returns is essential. Maybe it's time for clearer product
                            descriptions, better quality control, or a review of the return policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This project was a fantastic opportunity to see how data visualization can transform a struggling
                        business. By turning raw data into clear and engaging visuals, I gave Superstore the insights
                        they needed to chart a course toward a profitable future.</p>
