										<h3>Beyong The Bullet Points:</h3>
										<p>While a traditional resume can offer a snapshot of my professional life, it can't capture the full story.  This page is dedicated to providing a glimpse into the experiences and passions that have shaped my career path, leading me to pursue my current goal of becoming a Business Intelligence Analyst. </p>
										
										<h3>From Diverse Experiences to a Focused Path:</h3>
										<p>My background is a tapestry of diverse roles. I've navigated the fast-paced world of food delivery as a DoorDash driver, maintaining a stellar 5-star rating while ensuring timely and efficient service.  I've supported students with diverse learning needs as a Special Education Assistant, fostering a positive and productive learning environment.  And yes, I've even donned the hat of a Security Officer, prioritizing safety and vigilance in various settings.</p>
										<p>These experiences, while seemingly disparate, have instilled in me valuable skills – adaptability, communication, problem-solving, and a strong work ethic – that I carry into my current pursuits.</p>
										
										<h3>The Data Spark:</h3>
										<p>My true passion lies in the world of data.  I'm fascinated by its ability to tell stories, uncover hidden trends, and drive informed decision-making.  This fascination led me to pursue formal training in Business Intelligence:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Business Intelligence Analyst Bootcamp:</u> This intensive program provided me with a comprehensive foundation in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, culminating in a formal certification as a Business Intelligence Analyst.</li>
											<li><u>CrewTracker Software Externship:</u> I had the opportunity to apply my newfound skills in a real-world setting, contributing to a large-scale Power BI conversion project. This involved translating complex SQL queries and formulas into DAX, demonstrating my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>A Life Long Learner:</h3>
										<p>My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my academic pursuits:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><u>Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania:</u> I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, delving into the complexities of human behavior and cognition. I further honed my communication and teaching skills by serving as a Teaching Assistant for General Psychology.</li>
											<li><u>Kutztown University:</u> Driven by a genuine interest in science, I pursued additional coursework in biology and allied health. This experience broadened my understanding of scientific principles and research methodologies.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Beyond the Classroom:</h3>
										<p>My pursuit of knowledge extends beyond traditional academia. I hold a TEFL certification, opening doors to potential opportunities in teaching English as a foreign language.  I'm also a strong communicator, capable of conveying complex information clearly and concisely, a skill honed through various roles, including my recent experience as a Tutor Assistant at TripleTen, where I guided students through challenging BI concepts.</p>

										<h3>Looking Ahead:</h3>
										<p>I'm eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to a data-driven organization. If you're seeking a passionate and dedicated BI Analyst with a proven track record of success, I invite you to connect with me. Let's explore how my skills can help you achieve your business objectives.</p>
